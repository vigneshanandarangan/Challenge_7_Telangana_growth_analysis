### Project Overview

This Project aimed at the case of customers default payments in Taiwan and compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. 

I worked with the project in Default of credit card clients. I focused on predicting the Default list of customer. I followed a process of problem definition, gathering data, preparing data, explanatory data analysis, coming up with a data model, validating the model, and optimizing the model further.

Let's take a look at the steps
